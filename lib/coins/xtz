Tezos addresses can be derived from both Ed25519 and Secp256k1 key pairs. 

Here are examples of Tezos addresses using both protocols:

    Ed25519 Address:
        Tezos addresses derived from Ed25519 public keys typically start with tz1.
        Example: tz1VSUr8wwNhLAzempoch5d6hLRiTh8Cjcjb

    Secp256k1 Address:
        Tezos addresses derived from Secp256k1 public keys typically start with tz2.
        Example: tz28Md7JtavhSBXFK3tRWRjH4TB4fTBvS4X7

Address Derivation Process

For a bit more detail on how these addresses are derived:

    Ed25519 (tz1) Address:
        A public key is derived from an Ed25519 private key.
        The public key is hashed using SHA256.
        The first 20 bytes of the SHA256 hash are taken.
        The result is base58 encoded with a tz1 prefix.

    Secp256k1 (tz2) Address:
        A public key is derived from a Secp256k1 private key.
        The public key is hashed using SHA256.
        The first 20 bytes of the SHA256 hash are taken.
        The result is base58 encoded with a tz2 prefix.
